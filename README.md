Working with git in our team:

1. When working on something, you need the issue you are working on
2. If the issue you are working on doesn't exist, add a new issue
3. When starting to work on something **create new branch**
4. The name of the branch should contain the number of the issue at the end, in the following structure:
        {Some name for the branch} - {Number of issue}     
        For example:
        ManagerObjectFeature- 15
5. After finish working, when you want to **commit your work**:
6. At the end of the commit message, you add (#NumOfIssue):
        {Commit message} (#{Number of issue})
        For example:
        Fixing manager create new store method (#30)
