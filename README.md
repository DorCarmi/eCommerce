Repository for the main process of the project


Working with git in our team:

1. When working on something, you need the issue you are working on
2. If the issue you are working on doesn't exist, add a new issue
3. When starting to work on something create new branch
4. The name of the branch should contain the number of the issue at the end, in the following structure:
        {Some name for the branch} - {Number of issue}     
        For example:
        ManagerObjectFeature- 15
5. After finish working, when you want to commit your work:
6. At the end of the commit message, you add (#NumOfIssue):
        {Commit message} (#{Number of issue})
        For example:
        Fixing manager create new store method (#30)
